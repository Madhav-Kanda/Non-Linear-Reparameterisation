This repository contains the code for Windowed Non Linear Reparameterization built on top of Blacjax. This work was done as a part of summer internship at Aalto University under the guidance of Dr. Nikolas Siccha and Prof. Aki Vehtari.

### Why:

At times MCMC algorithms have trouble sampling from distributions. One such example is Nealâ€™s funnel in which due to strong non-linear dependence between latent variables. Non-centering the model removes this dependence, converting the funnel into a spherical Gaussian distribution.
